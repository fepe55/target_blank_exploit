# target="_blank" exploit
Simple test based on https://www.tutorialdocs.com/article/html-opener-blank.html

# How to run

Just clone this repo, open `eins.html` in your favourite browser (a double-click should do it) and click on the link.
Or just go to https://fepe55.github.io/target_blank_exploit/

# How can I prevent this from happening

As you can see in [1], whenever you use `target="_blank"` in an anchor element, also add `rel="noopener"`. And for good measure, you could make it `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. If you are targeting old browsers you should do some Javascript magic, also on [1] 

# What kind of sorcery is this?
